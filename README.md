# Human Motion Detection using Wi-Fi 2022
This is my Master project in NUS.<br>

## Introduction
In the rapid advancement of commercial Wi-Fi devices, this project explores a Wi-Fi based motion detection method for "through the wall" scenarios. Leveraging channel state information (CSI) changes due to indoor body movements, the proposed system can detect and classify seven unique human motions. It employs a conjugate multiplication algorithm for noise removal, Principal Component Analysis for denoising and feature extraction, and a support vector machine for movement detection. A specially designed channel clean algorithm mitigates multipath interference, while a 1D Convolutional Neural Network classifies motions. Experimentally, the system boasts 98% accuracy in movement detection and over 95% in motion classification.
