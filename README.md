# Human Motion Detection using Wi-Fi 2022
This is my Master project in NUS.<br>
My superviser is Prof.Cuo Yongxin homepage:https://www.ece.nus.edu.sg/stfpage/eleguoyx/.


## Introduction
In the rapid advancement of commercial Wi-Fi devices, this project explores a Wi-Fi based motion detection method for "through the wall" scenarios. Leveraging channel state information (CSI) changes due to indoor body movements, the proposed system can detect and classify seven unique human motions. It employs a conjugate multiplication algorithm for noise removal, Principal Component Analysis for denoising and feature extraction, and a support vector machine for movement detection. A specially designed channel clean algorithm mitigates multipath interference, while a 1D Convolutional Neural Network classifies motions. Experimentally, the system boasts 98% accuracy in movement detection and over 95% in motion classification.

## Main contribution
(1)To the best of my acknowledgment, this system is the first one to detect 7 human motions in through the wall scenario. <br>
(2)Proposed a new channel clean algorithm to reduce the the multipath interference in through the wall scenario.<br>
(3)Achieve 98% accuracy in movement detection and 95% accuracy in motion classification.<br>

## Overview of the system

In this project, human motion is monitored using Channel-State-Information (CSI). CSI data provides amplitude and phase time sequences for each subcarrier, forming the foundation for an amplitude and phase-based system. A Support-Vector-Machine (SVM) is trained to determine the presence of human movement, while a random forest differentiates walking from other motions. Additionally, two 1-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Networks are utilized: one to identify the direction of movement and another to classify five distinct types of motion. The entire system's workflow is depicted in the figure.
